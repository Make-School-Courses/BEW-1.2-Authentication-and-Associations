## Tabbed Schedule - EXAMPLE

**How to make a tabbed schedule.**

- The code that does this is in comments, so view the raw markdown to see what's going on.
- When you view the Docsify website of the course, the tabs will appear.
- They will NOT appear by just viewing on GitHub

### Instructions

1. Copy the appropriate schedule(s) from the above list with the correct dates
1. View the example below and copy the commented out code to generate the tabs:
    1. `<!-- tabs:start -->` - put at the beginning of where you want tabs
    1. `<!-- omit in toc -->` - put at the beginning of each header within the tabs
    1. `<!-- tabs:end -->` - put at the end of where you want tabs (i.e. at the end of the last schedule)

**See below example**

<!-- tabs:start -->
<!-- omit in toc -->

## Class Assignments

We will be using [Gradescope](gradescope.com), which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. *All assigned work will be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope.*

As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your Gradescope login is your Make School email, and your password can be changed at [https://gradescope.com/reset_password](https://gradescope.com/reset_password). The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.
