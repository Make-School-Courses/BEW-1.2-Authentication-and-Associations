## Gradescope & Submission

We will be using [Gradescope](gradescope.com), which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. *All assigned work will be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope.*

As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your Gradescope login is your Make School email, and your password can be changed at [https://gradescope.com/reset_password](https://gradescope.com/reset_password). The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.


## Late Submission Policy

In this class, we will be using student submissions as material for in-class discussions and activities, such as peer code reviews. **If you do not submit your homework assignments by the deadline, you will miss out on these opportunities.** However, no explicit late penalty will be applied for submissions under 1 week late. You may also re-submit your work to correct errors and increase your homework score.

Assignments or corrections submitted **more than 7 days (1 week) late** will **not** be accepted.

The **absolute last day** to submit any assignment will be **Friday, March 5 at 11:59 PM**. After that, no other extensions may be granted even in extenuating circumstances due to a hard deadline for submitting grades.

If you require accommodations or have extenuating circumstances such as prolonged illness, please contact your instructor to request an extension.


## Class Recordings

All class recordings will be available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PwxOS92ryVH1xQ6jdVcZdc0j7VmnraH9) no later than 24 hours after the class session. For privacy reasons, please do not share the recordings outside of the Make School student body.


## Attendance Policy

Each student will be allowed **2 (two) unexcused absences** and **2 (two) excused absences** per course per term. An absence is excused if you reach out to your instructor prior to class to explain why you can't make it. If you exceed the total number of allowed absences, you will be withdrawn from the course.


## Academic Honesty Policy

At Make School, we highly encourage collaboration between students on assignments. Working with other people is the best way to learn!

However, there's a big difference between **collaboration** (writing code together with another person) and **plagiarism** (copying code from a classmate or outside source without providing proper attribution). 

Here are some guidelines to follow in order to avoid plagiarism:

1. If you are looking at an outside source for help, **close the window** containing the code before writing your own solution.
1. Do not write down a line of code unless you **completely understand** how it works. (This is true even if the source you're referencing is the lesson slides/examples/etc!)
1. If your code is still similar to an outside source or another student's, **provide attribution** by adding a comment to your code explaining where it was taken from.

We take academic honesty very seriously at Make School. The consequences for violating the policy are as follows:

- You will be required to write a [Self-Reflection Letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/140_PHfDh7gu33OZI_caxEtvNzAlAepjnGcbQcXZ-MRo/edit?usp=sharing) to reflect on how your actions affected others.
- If this is your first offense, you may be permitted to redo the assignment for a reduced grade (at the instructor's discretion).
- The incident will be added to your permanent record at Make School and you may be placed on a Participation Improvement Plan (PIP).

For subsequent offenses, more serious consequences may be considered. For more information, please see [Make School's academic honesty policy](https://make.sc/academic-honesty-policy).
